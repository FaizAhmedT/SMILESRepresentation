This is a Python app developed to structurally represent biological molecules. We have used the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation for structural representation. Our app uses the RDKit and PyQt5 libraries for its graphical user interface. There are external libraries and packages used as well to draw molecular structures and analyze their details. All the functionalities of this app are based on its user input. The user input involves a string of specific biological molecules in SMILES format and its CHEMBL ID. This app aims to be useful in various biological fields where visualizing molecules is an important task like drug discovery.
